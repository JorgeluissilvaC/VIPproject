   Introduction <introduction>
   Planned Tasks <planned_tasks>

This documentation comprises in depth information for both people trying to compile and use the platform in their own solutions, without much customization, and for people that want either to extend this project or use parts of it in their owns. Jump into the Introduction to get an overview of the project, its people and the problematic we want to solve (the objectives are clearly specified). Usage section is of particular interest for everyone that attempts to use the platform in anyway. The project was coded in a modular way, and you can take a look at the general design criteria and its particular components in the Platform Design section.
