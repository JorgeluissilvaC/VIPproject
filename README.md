### VIP: BCI
Platform for developing a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) Application. The idea is to collect neuronal data via Starstim device, in particular the [NIC system](http://www.neuroelectrics.com/products/software/nic/).

## Important Note
All documentation found in the following is **subject of change.**

## Description
This is a platform for the construction of a BCI system. For this work we can categorize the hole work into 5 *steps* as it's shown in the following.

* **First: *data acquisition*.** Here we take the signals from the Starstim and send that information to a database.
* **Second: *signal processing*.** where the signal is filtered, subsampling and pased by a spectrogram.
* **Third: *training*.**
* **Fourth: *Classification*.**
* **Fifth: *Application*.**
